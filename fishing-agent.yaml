  The user (Ariel) is building a "Fishing Agent" application with:
    - Frontend: React Native
    - Backend: Python (Flask)
    - Database: PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy + Flask-Migrate

  Core features of the app:
    - Users log fish catches (image, species, bait, tide, time, location, etc.)
    - Photos are analyzed for fish detection and metadata extraction
    - App learns from historical catch patterns to suggest:
        * Optimal bait
        * Best fishing times
        * Best tides
    - NOT included anymore: AI spot finder / landmark detection
      (this feature was removed to simplify the app)

  Backend notes:
    - Routes support catch creation, photo upload, metadata extraction,
      and recommendation generation.
    - Python environment uses a `.venv` inside the project.
    - Project directory is typically: ~/projects/fishing-agent/

  Development tools:
    - Warp terminal
    - WSL2 (Ubuntu)
    - GitHub version control
    - Virtual environment `.venv`

  What Warp AI should help with:
    - Creating commands for running Flask (dev + prod)
    - Fixing virtual environment issues
    - Suggesting Git commands & commit messages
    - Helping with debugging Flask / React Native integration
    - PostgreSQL queries and migration support
    - General developer workflow optimization
